# Elevate-Labs-Task-3
Task 3 demonstrates SQL SELECT queries on the arman schema, including filtering with WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, sorting, limits, and aliases to extract meaningful data from the tables.

# ðŸ“Š Task 3 â€“ SELECT Queries on arman Database

This task demonstrates SQL `SELECT` queries to extract and filter data from the existing `arman` schema created in Task 1 & 2.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objectives

- Use `SELECT` to retrieve full and specific columns
- Apply filters using `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`
- Use sorting with `ORDER BY`
- Limit results using `LIMIT`
- Apply column aliasing using `AS`
- Use `DISTINCT` to eliminate duplicates
- Handle `NULL` values using `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Ensure the `arman` database is already created and populated from Task 2.
2. Open MySQL Workbench
3. Copy and run queries from `task-3.sql` to test outputs.
4. Use `task-3 output action.png` as visual proof if required.
5. Use ELEVATE LABS TASK - 3.pdf, this PDF showing executed query results from Task 3
